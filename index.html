            EcoDoer is an app which provides features to make it easier and more fun to choose an eco friendly way of living.<br>
            Badges can be unlocked by doing certain tasks, e.g. having a meat free dinner or fixing broken furniture. Help
            to complete these tasks can be found under Tips & Tricks by watching DIY videos or looking through the daily tips.<br>
            A map helps the user to locate places that provide some kind of eco friendly service such as thrift stores,
            recycling stations and local producers. <br>To keep track of every eco friendly task that has been done and to see
            where to improve, personal statistics gives an overview of how the user is doing. <br>With EcoDoer, everyone can join
            in on the common goal to a healthier planet.

            <p>With the development of our civilization, the influence of technogenic and anthropogenic factors on the natural environment has constantly increased. These factors were predominantly destructive and negative, and had a great impact on the human community. That is why ecological problems and environmental protection are the top challenges for all mankind. <br>
                Nowadays many people are preoccupied with the environment and the future of our planet, but feel helpless in dealing with such challenges. Such problems are addressed at the international, regional and national levels. <br> Our idea is aimed at including as many people as possible and solving a global problem at the micro level, or in other words, at the individual level.
                Each person can make a small contribution, which in general will have a huge effect in solving one of the most important problems of our time.
                <br><br>
                <b>Micro efforts - Macro effects</b>
                <br><br>
                We all want to contribute to a healthier planet, and make the right/green choices - but how? We propose a solution with a combined database and reward system. It will help you compare products, services and actions - and reward and encourage you to make the eco-friendly choice!
                <br><br>
                Meet EcoDoer – an app for your smartphone to help you make greener and more eco-friendly micro-choices and -actions.
                EcoDoer encourages eco-friendly habits with its rewards system, while also helping you find greener choices with its crowd-sourced database.
